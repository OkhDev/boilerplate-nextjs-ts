# Next.js Boilerplate with Styled Components, Husky, and more!

A template for **Next.js** projects using TypeScript and other packages. All packages have been pre-configured to work right out of the box. It can easily be deployed to Vercel and it is what I personally use when creating a new project.

## **⚠️ Repo Update**

`Current Next.js Version: 12.3.1`

Next.js just had their 2022 conference unveiling **Next.js 13** with major new features and optimizations. I will do my best to update this branch to **Next.js 13** to work with the packages below if they allow me to, as some packages may need to be updated to work properly.

> To learn more about **Next.js 13**, visit their Blog page [here](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13).
